My work has been constantly inspired by politics, gender equality and the media.

When I was 3 years old I wanted to become a forester, at 11 an architect, by 14 I wanted to attend political science or become an actress.
I became a vegetarian, aesthetic, politically aware theatre director and multimedia artist.

I live in London with my two kids (a 10 year-old boy with a big passion for numbers and a 7 year-old anarchist) and their dad.
In my spare time I take lots of pictures.
