Piece: Fragmented Memories
<br>
<br>
Interactive visual art installation and performance
<br>
Questioning a memory, what is it made of. How many small details, other parallel realities, memories, energy vibrations was it affected by. Fragments of visual and verbal ideas are collaged together to create a particular memory of this moment in this time and space.
<br>
While the observers experience the creation of memories being executed by the artist, they can as well get closer to directing these memories, affecting new ones, by creating small collages on the prepared sheets of paper and attaching them to the wall. 
<br>
Start the interaction.
