Piece: In Limine

Performance / Dance

<br>
From the Latin limen-m√¨nis, threshold but also beginning, end, fulfillment.
<br>
<br>
In a broader sense it may refer to a "here" and a "beyond" as a search for one
different condition.
The Skin, limiting between the "inside" (the body - the matter that it possesses in itself the
principle of movement, instrument of the practical action of a spiritual conscience) ed
the "outside" (otherness - the "not me"), reservoir of receptors, means of exchange e
translator of physical and chemical stimuli, it is the threshold that separates the inexpressible from
us
we bring in the incomprehensible that is outside us, the barrier that defines us.
<br>
<br>
Movement, time on the body and muscles under the skin, plasma and alter
this barrier, renewing both its interior and exterior.
<br>
<br>
It is only on the threshold, it is only through movement that their dialogue takes place
impossible, through the search for a balance, for an immaterial proprioception,
expressed with symmetrical geometries and paramorphisms that challenge static and dynamic.
