Piece: Dedicated to Solanum Tuberosum
<br>
<br>
The work explores the history and rumours about Trakų Vokės manor. To commemorate the lives of Solanum Tuberosum an experience of haunting is created in the basement of the manor. The stories about the basement being used for the research of potatoes during the Soviet era is used as a starting point for the work.

<br>
Even in the most direct communication, there is always a media between the subjects: A non-verbal thought is transformed into images, sounds or language, which is interpreted and transformed into a non-verbal thought once again. The initial thought and the received thought are never the same. 
This noise can be considered as some form of an obstacle in communication, however, I consider the transformation processes between different media to be an element, which generates something new, interesting and reveals the media itself, therefore I use it as a central topic in my creative practice.
