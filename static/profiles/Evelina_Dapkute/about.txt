Bonsai Kitten is a made-up cat raising technique, when a little kitten is put in a jar or small clear container and while growing up its body fills all the free space in the container, becoming a „beautiful“ animal/house decoration. Sometimes we don't need much to go beyond the limits of humanity. And sometimes we can't even understand that we've done something wrong. Certain things become too self-evident, so drawing a line between "can" and "can't" can just be impossible. Not all "beautiful" is "possible" and not everything that’s possible can fully satisfy.
