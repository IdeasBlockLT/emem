At the EmEm Art Fest two pieces from the ongoing series “The Oddities” are on display. This series is made up of a collection of of paintings built on discovering misfit pieces, assembled together from parts that at points are in touch with known reality, a discovery of a world of mismatched “things” presented one piece at a time. These pieces are based not as much on process of making as on one of discovering a world created in amalgamating previous places, narratives and experiences, a little bit like telling a story viewed through a distorted lens.
