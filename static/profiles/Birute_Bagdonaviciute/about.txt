I have learned about immortal cells of Henrietta Lacks from my friend J.K., who is now doing her PhD thesis in biology, when she had welcomed me in her laboratory. It fascinated me, both the personal story of Henrietta, her background from coloured America, tragic life, treatment as the source of cells without her and her family consent or even informing. And then the story of immortal cells, which apparently exists near us in the same physical Universe. And the knowledge about it, reachable by everyone as a ready-made in internet... I felt very much inspired to use this story in my art, just was not sure how to connect the dots. The old aging Trakų Vokė manner, it’s dirty old cellars, bright renovated orangery, large halls fake decorated for TV series – it seems, that all together it gives a try to get at least one second of immortality. And it finally made me clear how I want to tell the story of immortal cells of Henrietta Lacks.
