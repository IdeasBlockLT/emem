According to Masaru Emoto's findings on experiments with water, the water molecules change
 their structure depending on the emotion that the sound brings. It was noticed that high frequency 
emotions in sounds, for instance "I love you, thank you" and classical music, create complex and symmetrical crystals,
whereas water affected by low frequencies (die, idiot, etc.) looses it's crystal structure and becimes similar to mud puddles. 
Having in mind that all earthly organisms are liquid-based, the experiment findings confirm the importance of
high frequency emotions for growth and development. Singing and talking to the plants now looks logical.

The piece is performed in an empty orangery in Traku Vokes manor. The performer is sitting in the middle of an orangery, facing the park behind windows
and is making sound with the Cello or playing impromtu. The doors of orangery are closed but not locked. Movement in orangery is not forbidden nor encouraged.

Performance time - several hours.

Music for the Plants is music for the memory of plants, as an expression of nostalgia and expression of faith.
The orangery itself creates imaginary visuals of it's past when it was full of exotic flora. The artist aims to create an environment of these 
imaginary memories of orangery, perform music and emit high frequency sounds, as an expression of love to the creation,
stimulate the growth of plants and their development and at the same time, to stimulate her own development. 
This aspect makes the artist and the spectator to near proximity with the plant or the memory of the plant, the plant or the memory of plant can be experienced
thought the comprehension of own finite fragility.
