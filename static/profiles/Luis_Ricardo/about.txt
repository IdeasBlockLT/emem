Luis Ricardo is a Mexican artist born in Puebla (1979). He draws gag cartoons and paints with the centuries-old technique of the egg tempera plus children's crayons and ink melted on paper. His work is bizarre, obsessive and suffers from horror vacui. As a cartoonist, he has been awarded the 3rd prize in the International saloon of humor at Santa Clara, Cuba in December 2018.
