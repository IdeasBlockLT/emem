Site-specific object installation placed variously around the Trakų Vokės Manor.

<br>
The three reliefs were made specifically for the Trakų Vokės Manor. The work plays with the viewer a game of memory and putting the puzzle pieces back together. The wooden ornamented ceilings of the manor in one of the halls were taken as a starting point. The objects are as if a negative form cast from the ornaments above and fallen to the ground. The vibrant blue color and the rough shape reminds one of a lego brick piece and accentuates the mental motion of putting the pieces back where they belong.

Barbora (Lithuania, 1996) is a young generation artist. Born and lives in Vilnius, Lithuania. In 2015 graduated from National M. K. Čiurlionis Art School, sculpture specialization. In 2019 Graduated From Vilnius Art Academy, sculpture department. Took part in group exhibitions at Kaunas gallery "Kabinetas" (2016), CAC "Emotional Trilogy" by Austėja Vilkaitytė (2017), Centre of Polish Sculpture in Oronsko (2019). In her artistic practice she aims to understand the distinctive logic of a dream - where the components of the overall dream experience arrive from various places in the subconscious. Often using an existing visual element of a certain place, she forces it through a variety of transformations ending up with a deformed and re-constructed result, that is fully open to the viewers interpretation.
