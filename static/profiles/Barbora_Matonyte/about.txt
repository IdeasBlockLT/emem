Piece: Vol. 2
<br>
<br>
Site-specific object installation placed variously around the Trakų Vokės Manor.
<br>
The three reliefs were made specifically for the Trakų Vokės Manor.
<br>
The work plays with the viewer a game of memory and putting the puzzle pieces back together. 
<br>
The wooden ornamented ceilings of the manor in one of the halls were taken as a starting point. 
<br>
The objects are as if a negative form cast from the ornaments above and fallen to the ground. 
<br>
The vibrant blue color and the rough shape reminds one of a lego brick piece and accentuates the 
mental motion of putting the pieces back where they belong.

Barbora (Lithuania, 1996) is a young generation artist. Born and lives in Vilnius, Lithuania. In her artistic 
practice she aims to understand the distinctive logic of a dream - where the components of the overall dream
 experience arrive from various places in the subconscious. Often using an existing visual element of certain place, 
she forces it through a variety of transformations ending up with a deformed and re-constructed product, that is fully open to the viewers interpretation.
