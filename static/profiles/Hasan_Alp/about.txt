Piece: Divinitive memory
<br>
<br>
Music / performance 
<br>
<br>
The performance aims to point out the memory of evil in a divinitive sense. The act takes reference by the Holy Quran. Specifically from how sins trigger a reaction in the soul and leave black marks in the sinners hearth. The person can be clean again with a several different ways but in this play the character doesn't stop doing evil until his hearth starts bleeding black. The play suggest that every memory we have will have effects on us in the real life and also in the afterlife. Its not impossible to feel clean again after doing something very filthy if you take the right action in time and recover from your mistakes. However when things slip out of hand it can get painful and lead to things even more terrifying. In this act the situation leads to chaos within the person's inner self. The act closes with a song called Divine Memory which explains the situation of the character and the show will move on with a couple of extra songs of the artist. The songs will be progressive acoustic guitar music with percussive guitar techniques.
