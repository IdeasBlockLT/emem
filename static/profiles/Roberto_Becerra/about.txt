Piece: Memory loss 
<br>
<br>
Sound art installation in the basement of Trakų Vokės Manor.

<br>
The work approaches the memory processes at the time they drive into a sinking tunnel of oblivion. Memory loss is an eerie sensation, and the inexplicable edges at which understanding of the mind ceasses. At the mercy of lost ideas.
