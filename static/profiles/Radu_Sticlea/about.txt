Piece: Idle Sounds of Abandonment
<br>
<br>
Sound Instalation
<br>
<br>
Exploration of state through sonic navigation across abandoned sites of Vilnius. This opens a
conversation about the possibility of revitalization and its benefits toward the community,
towards the vacant space, towards its memory. With the experimental approach, we seek
connection between physical and emotional consequences of abandonment, how we can
correlate the feelings and attitudes with the environment of a venue which was left behind,
now undesired and discarded. Presenting the power of memory and heritage by giving a voice
to certain points of the city. What do they hear? What can they express?
